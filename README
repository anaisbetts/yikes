What is Yikes?
---------------

Yikes is a program that takes a source library and recreates the same library in
iPod Video format (iPod Video / iPod Touch / iPhone). It skips videos that are
already there, so you can set it up to run on a periodic basis.

Future versions will run in the background, and automatically convert files when
the computer is idle, as well as publish an RSS feed that you can subscribe to
in iTunes.

So when this is all finished, you'll set Yikes to run on startup, point it at
your videos, and add computername.local:8080 as a podcast. If you have set up a
"Season Pass"-type automatic Bittorrent download of shows, this means that every
day your videos automatically get sync'ed to your iPod!


To build:
	rake && rake ffmpeg 	# Takes forever, only works on Mac/Linux
	rake test    # If it works, you're good

To run:
	ruby lib/main.rb --help
