What is V4Studio?
------------------

This piece of software is an authoring tool to design and encode MPEG-4 content
at large (audio, video, still picture, vector graphics and text). The current
version has no support for audio, video or still picture. But if you edit an
existing mp4 files that contains some media, they will remain in the output mp4.

This tool was design based on the rendering system of the gpac project but the
GUI is written using wxWindows (www.wxwindows.org).

The current version allows you to open an mp4 file or a bt file, to edit the
graphical elements (vector graphics, text) of the initial BIFS scene. You can
then save the result to an mp4 file. Editing is very limited for the moment, you
can:
- add nodes within a node depending on the context.
- delete nodes
- change some field values (float, int, string, colours, points)
- move objects.

Problems:
---------
Since it is in a version early stage, this software has known bugs (fields list
view, node drag and drop, node deletions) and may have some more unknown ones.

How to install V4Studio?
--------------------------
I'm using Windows 2000 and I haven't tried it yet on other platforms. Please
report any problem. Only the Debug version has been tested.

On Windows:
Get the source from the gpac project http://gpac.sourceforge.net

Compiling:
---------
Open the GPAC.dsw file. Set the V4Studio project active and build it. It will
build also libgpac.dll.

The current version uses a hard-coded path to a configuration file GPAC.cfg.
Before compiling, you should change that path to your path. In the file
wxGPACPanel.cpp, change:
	strcpy(config_path, "E:\\MesProjets\\gpac\\gpac\\bin\\Debug");
into:
	strcpy(config_path, <gpac_path_with_double_backslash>\\gpac\\bin\\w32_deb");

To link, it needs the js32.lib. Place it under gpac/extra_lib/lib/w32_deb.

To link, you also need some elements from wxWidgets, version 2.5.2. You need to change the path
to the wxWidgets include and library directories, in tools->options, Directories tab
Add to include directories:
<wxWidgets_path>\wxWidgets\include
<wxWidgets_path>\wxWidgets\contrib\include
<wxWidgets_path>\wxWidgets\lib\mswd

Add to library directories:
<wxWidgets_path>\wxWidgets\lib
<wxWidgets_path>\wxWidgets\contrib\lib

The following libs from wxWidgets are required and should be present in V4Studio project linker settings:
wxmsw25d_html.lib wxbase25d.lib wxmsw25d_core.lib wxmsw25d_adv.lib wxbase25d_xml.lib wxexpatd.lib wxmsw25d_xrc.lib 
(remove the 'd' for release versions)


Once this is done, you should be able to compile V4Studio.exe.

Running:
--------
To run the tool, you should have a valid GPAC.cfg file. If you don't have the
GPAC.CFG file, here a default content, where you should change <gpac_root_path>
------------------------------------
[General]
ModulesDirectory=<gpac_root_path>\gpac\bin\Debug\
CacheDirectory=<gpac_root_path>\gpac\bin\Debug\cache

[Rendering]
DriverName=gdip_rend
AntiAlias=All

[Audio]
ForceConfig=yes
NumBuffers=8
TotalDuration=400
DriverName=dx_hw

[FontEngine]
DriverName=gdip_rend
FontDirectory=C:\WINNT\Fonts

[Video]
DriverName=dx_hw

[System]
ThreadingPolicy=Free
Priority=normal
-----------------------------------------

You need also at least the plugin for the Rendering section (here gdip_rend),
the Video section (here dx_hw), the audio section (here dx_hw). So you should
also compile the dll for the 2 projects gdip_rend, and dx_hw. Then put the dll
in the modules Directory.

To run the tool outside VC++, copy the V4Studio.exe file in a PATH and copy the
rc directory into the same PATH. The program should run without error messages.

If GPAC has been compiled with ECMAScript support, you will
also have to copy the js32.dll into the execution directory (or any directory in
the machine PATH)

Other platforms:
To be tested ...
