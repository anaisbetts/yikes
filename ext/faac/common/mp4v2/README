MP4V2 Library
=============

This library provides functions to read, create, and modify mp4 files.

The detailed documentation of the library is available as a set of man pages 
in mpeg4ip/doc/mp4v2. The MP4.3 man page gives an overview of the library.

Alternately mp4.h in this directory specifies the complete API.

The file INTERNALS provides an overview of what is happening behind the API. 
Note that although we using C++ object oriented features internally, that's 
all hidden behind a flat C style API (with C linkage conventions).

The test and util subdirectories contain some simple programs that use 
this library.

To use this library in your application, it should be sufficient to:

1) add mpeg4ip/include and mpeg4ip/lib/mp4v2 to your INCLUDE path,
	e.g. gcc -Impeg4ip/include -Impeg4ip/lib/mp4v2 ...

2) add mpeg4ip/lib/mp4v2/libmp4v2.la (or /usr/local/lib/libmp4v2.la)
	e.g. gcc ... -o foo foo.cpp mpeg4ip/lib/mp4v2/libmp4v2.a

3) include mp4.h into your code,
	e.g. #include <mp4.h>
